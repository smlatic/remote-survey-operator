# Variations in Sound Speed and Acoustic Positioning

**Q: How does the speed of sound vary in water, and what factors influence it?**

A: The speed of sound in water is influenced by temperature, salinity, and pressure. These factors create a sound speed profile, which varies with depth and location.

**Q: How does variation in sound speed affect acoustic positioning?**

A: If the actual speed of sound varies due to changes in temperature, salinity, or pressure, but a constant speed is assumed, the calculated distances could be off. This affects the accuracy of acoustic positioning.

---
**Q: How are variations in sound speed corrected in acoustic positioning?**

A: Variations in sound speed are corrected by measuring the sound speed profile using a device like a Sound Velocity Profiler (SVP) or Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor. The sound speed profile is used to correct the travel time measurements of the acoustic signals, improving positioning accuracy.
