# Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and Dead Reckoning

**Q: Can you explain how Inertial Navigation Systems work?**

A: Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) work by using the vehicle's own sensed data to calculate its position, orientation, and velocity without needing external references. It uses the principles of dead reckoning to calculate the new position based on a known starting point, orientation, and velocity.

**Q: What is the principle of dead reckoning?**

A: Dead reckoning is a method of estimating current position based on a previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time, and course.

**Q: Can you relate the blindfolded walking analogy to how INS works?**

A: INS working principle is similar to a blindfolded person estimating their position based on their starting point, the distance they've walked, and the direction they've moved in. This is essentially how dead reckoning works.

---
**Q: Why would you choose to use INS in navigation?**

A: INS is chosen when external references like GPS or acoustic positioning systems are unreliable or unavailable. Examples of environments where INS would be especially useful include underwater, inside tunnels, or in space.
