**Q: How are Latitude and Longitude used together?**

A: Latitude and Longitude are used together to specify precise points on the Earth's surface. Latitude gives the North-South position, and Longitude gives the East-West position.

**Q: What is an example of a location with its Latitude and Longitude coordinates?**

A: New York City, for instance, is located at approximately 40.71 degrees latitude (North) and -74.01 degrees longitude (West).

**Q: What is the analogy for understanding Latitude and Longitude?**

A: Think of Latitude and Longitude like a grid on a map or a game of "Battleship". Latitude lines run horizontally and give the North-South position, while Longitude lines run vertically and give the East-West position. The intersection of a specific Latitude and Longitude gives a precise point on the Earth's surface.
