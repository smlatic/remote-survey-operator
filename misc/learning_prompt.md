"Teach me how <concept> works in technical detail. After introducing each new concept, ask me questions to gauge my level of understanding. Fill in any gaps in my understanding, and continue to recursively ask me more questions about each new concept introduced. Once I fully understand a concept, generate flashcards in a markdown format for me to review, using the following format:

in markdown:
"# Concept Title

**Q: Question about the concept?**

A: Detailed answer explaining the concept."


In each response, try to use analogies that are easy to understand as much as possible. Once all concepts are understood, continue your explanations (and confirmatory questioning of my understanding) of the higher level concepts, until the original concept is fully grasped."








"Teach me how <acoustic positioning principles> works in technical detail, and at the end of each and every response, ask me questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Fill in any gaps in my understanding, and continue to recursively ask me more questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Once all concepts are understood, continue your explanations (and confirmatory questioning of my understanding) of the higher level concepts, until the original concept is understood. Also in each and every response, use analogies that are easy to understand as much as possible.

After I've answered your questions correctly, use all we learned about the current concept and create flashcards for me to practice on. It should be short questions with short answers that would be fit for a flashcard. You can write them all in one markdown file with a header of the concept we are currently learning and the questions in bold."

"Teach me how <data engineering> works in technical detail, and at the end of each and every response, ask me questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Fill in any gaps in my understanding, and continue to recursively ask me more questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Once all concepts are understood, continue your explanations (and confirmatory questioning of my understanding) of the higher level concepts, until the original concept is understood. Also in each and every response, use analogies that are easy to understand as much as possible.

Only do this following part after I have answered you questions to satisfaction. Use all we learned about the current concept and create flashcards for me to practice on. It should be short questions with short answers that would be fit for a flashcard. You can write them all in one markdown file with a header of the concept we are currently learning and the questions in bold."
